# Extremely frustrating at first, but remarkably powerful, and humbling.

## My initial fear was that I would overwrite some shared repository upstream with piddling, wrong-headed commits.
## This was superceded by being rebuffed by git telling me that I was in the editor still.
## Finally managed to write a second function to journal.js, and then use touch to add this new .md file.
## I'm curious to see if it will slot in beside README.md and journal.js as expected; I half-expect breakage.
