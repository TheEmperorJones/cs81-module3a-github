#First thoughts: Extremely frustrating at first, but remarkably powerful, and humbling.

My initial fear was that I would overwrite some shared repository upstream with piddling, wrong-headed commits.
This was superceded by being rebuffed by git telling me that I was in the editor still.
Finally managed to write a second function to journal.js, and then use touch to add this new .md file.
I'm curious to see if it will slot in beside README.md and journal.js as expected; I half-expect breakage.

#Exploring github

In poking around the history, I see that in my effort to pick up steam, I arrowed-up to the previous commands and inadvertently send the same commit discription to both my first and second commits, condemning them to posterity, as best I can tell.
